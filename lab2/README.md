## Object instantiation via constructors.

### Task1

* _**Write a class Box and instatiate an object via its constructor. The Box object should have three instance variables of floating number type(double): height, width, depth;**_

It should be possible to instantiate box object in 3 ways:

* without parameters (every attribute is instantiated to 1)
* With 1 parameter (every attribute is instantiated with that parameter)
* With 3 parameters for each attribute.
* The box must have also 2 methods for calculation of its surface area and volume.

### Task2

* _**Create a class Queue and instantiate 2 objects of this type. Each queue should have as state the number of elements from it and can be created via constructors of 2 types - with parameter and without it.**_

Implement add and get methods for adding elements to the queue and extraction of them.

Also implement two methods which should determine if the queue is empty or full. `<isEmpty(), isFull()>`.
